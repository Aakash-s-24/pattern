Scenario: Assembling a custom robot with different parts.

Overview
The Builder Pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. This pattern is particularly useful in a scenario where a custom robot needs to be assembled with various parts (e.g., arms, legs, sensors), providing a step-by-step approach to create complex objects while ensuring that the final object is consistent and complete.
